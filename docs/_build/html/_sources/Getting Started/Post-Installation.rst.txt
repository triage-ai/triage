Post-Install Setup Guide
========================

Once triage.ai has been installed, you must configure it via the manage panel before it is entirely usable. Only staff with admin privileges can access the manage panel. A temporary admin will be created when the server is first run with an email of 'admin@test.com' and password 'admin.' Once an actual staff member is created with the admin status, this temporary admin can be deleted.

Email Setup
-------------

triage.ai allows you to route an unlimited number of emails as incoming tickets. For detailed instructions, please see :doc:`Email Settings Guide <Email Settings>`.

Attachment Setup
-------------------

triage.ai allows for attachments to be included with web tickets and tickets created through emails. For detailed instructions, please see :doc:`Attachments Guide <../Plugins/Attachments with S3>`.

Help Topics
-----------

In addition to emails, clients/users can also use the online form to create tickets. Help topics help map online inquiries to a department and assign priority without requiring the user to select a department and/or ticket priority. This gives you the ability to route inquiries without exposing internal departments.


Departments
-----------

Departments help organize support teams by categorizing them based on different service areas and is for internal use only. To manage departments, go to the **Departments** tab in the **Manage Panel**.

Staff Members
-------------

triage.ai allows you to add an unlimited number of representatives to the system. Each staff member can be assigned to a department and can be assigned roles to determine permission level. Every staff account can be 'Admin' or 'Agent.'

Roles
-----------

Roles allow for customizing what actions agents are capable of doing. These can be assigned to agents upon creation.

System Preferences
------------------

To disable or change system settings, use the Settings Tab as an admin.
